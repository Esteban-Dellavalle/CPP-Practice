Here, I will have all the projects. For now, I have a projectile calculator. It's basic, but touches functions and consts, based on inputs from user to get the trajectory of a x projectile, its velocity, timeup, range, etc. 

Next steps:
- Build everything in classes, like a projectile class.
- Improve logic and semantics. Add correct measures to everything.
- Build a basic sfml 2D graphic to draw the trajectory.
